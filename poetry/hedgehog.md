guilty as charged  
sorry for action  
absolved of guilt  
forgiven transgression  
  
breathe in, let go  
story told, now you know  
hedgehogged, feel spines  
How close is too close  
  
Attached and foolish, I'll never learn  
how close is pain, how far reserved  
Borders open, one way street  
Close and shut, too much to speak  
  
Schools in, goodbye  
words will drift, friendship dies  
effort both, or effort one  
left alone, forgiven cried
