There is a point where there is nothing  
There is no tie. There are no restrictions.  
An endless and insurmountable sea seperates what could be and what is  
In this moment there is only what is and what you allow to be.  
There is a point where the tangled infinities of coincidence meet.  
Bursting from the void appears hope, happiness, lust, and love  
In these times, the feelings are shared, the curiosity is expressed  
The expressions are learned, the cues hinted and stored  
We learn and predict and build the image of our affection  
It is our mind that shapes the perceptions, and to this perception we endow and give ourselves.  
There is a point where you have given yourself away  
All you are willing to give has been placed on the table  
The scraps you hold are those so deep and secreted that they are covered in darkness  
They are the ones you will never say outloud  
The truths that binds the mind and breaks the soul in two when brought to light  
Light that pierces the veil our minds make to cover the horror we allow ourselves to become  
There is a point where those truths are given freely  
There is a fear in the moments of our greatest expression  
There is joy in this suffering agony.  
The curtain removed, the chains undone, the locks unhinged.  
The door swings loose against itself, the wind of our minds billowing it's frame  
There is a point where there is nothing left to say, but every reason to say it.  
This is the time when most fail to do what is needed.  
Just because one knows, does not mean the other does as well.  
Communication is two way and ten fold  
The pursuit of education should never stop with a partners.  
There is always something more to learn and love and hate  
There is a point.
