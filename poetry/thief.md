Find them there, all alone.  
Sitting, ready for you. Yearning to go.  
Not sly, look left, fate? look right.   
Sit down, glance. Should you? Might.   
Gauntlet thrown. A challenge sent.   
Truth in you, alway's you'll know  
Live with yourself
Integrity at stake.  
Take them, take them, if not then who?  
Give them back? No, they've come to you!  
Twisted, wonder, should you say    
no more. No less. Principle a thief slayed.
