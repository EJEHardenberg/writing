The blue in the sky matches the azure of the lake.  
Clouds billowing inside waves thunder.  
Rustling at the edges with leaves blossoming from silent sentinals.  
The busy of the day begins to take its pace.  
The hustle of the crows pushing life's race.  
Swift to run but slow to walk.  
The people look down and no one talks.  
Their phones in hand and their eyes glued.  
Moderation is key, it's sad but true.  
Technology ruining us as we're too ready to abuse.   
Don't miss your chance, fight the itch:   
to look down and text, and avoid commonplace   
interactions between us, we're limited too.   
What media tells us, becuase we're all skewed.    
Get up and go out. Bring your phone along   
an emergency device, for finding some fun.   
But when you're out there with your friends, eyes alight with laughter   
be in the moment, no need for social media chatter.
