Our words are deliberate and Chosen.  
Disconnect. Heart from Head. Objective.  
Still it fights. You know you shouldn't  
you keep on, and keep on.  
What words can please both sides?  
Tongue-tied and torn, making assumptions.  
Heart to heart agree, mind to mind coincide.  
Heart to head. Disconnect. Pull away.  
How close is too close?
Decide together, but one party will lose out, 
a perfect split? impossible. One to one, take the hit. 
Too close. But savoring each moment,  
the prick of spine from our dilemna a cross to bear.  
Bare our words. Bare our hopes. Bear our desires.
What's wrong. What's right. Who decides when we can't?
