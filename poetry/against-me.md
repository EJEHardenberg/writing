Against me I want your warmth to be   
Lay over me like a morning blanket   
wrapped induced comfort and I never want to leave   
Hair falls into my face and my mouth seeks yours like nuns seek God   
Devoted, no reason but faith and the desire to feel   
at peace with you; hands interleaved like branches of a tree   
Mind distracted, nothing can alarm.    
When I with you the angst is gone.   
Dependency? Maybe, but all of us are.   
On each other, on you, on me your body lies    
curved unlike my appetite for your smile   
It could be me in the stagelights of the part in your play   
of man, lover, thoughts soaked with grey.    
No need to fear, I am what I am, whatever role I have   
do my best to be. Friend, companion, clown, nothing at all.   
Wrapped tight in your arms, wrapped up in your life   
living, learning, loving, take some time to think, figure  
eights in my mind, can't deny what's real  
don't know how to feel.
