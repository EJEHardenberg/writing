Pacific blue of vast clouded oceans  
New green blossoms of trees below  
Scurrying between, walks of life, schedules met  
Shining through and tendrils of burnt air  
Reflected light on dark cool ground, coal black and unyielding.  
Wind whisping through brushed up bushes and leaves  
Standing still, regal and grey:  
Nothing to worry, and mourners to pray
