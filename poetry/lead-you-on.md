I can hear you say it  
The defense to actions true  
A smile you can't hide and  
the way in arms you  
feel when you're with me and I  
am with you  
  
In the way life, distance and past  
tripping us from behind with overcast  
hopes.  
Realism pacifism Romanticism is all  
poor annotations for you-ism  
Won't you want to want me when I wake up  
From this dream, nightmare, reality -- stop.  
  
What do you want? What do I want?  
Can't say the world for fear  
of betrayal, pain, hedgehogs dilemna,  
Can't speak before the other has spoken  
Think before you speak and listen before you act  
An eye for an eye the whole blind but  
listen prior speaking the silence shut  
us up until  
  
The courage to say. The bravery to tell  
Heart on the sleeve for piercing words  
wounded before and wounded again  
torn and frayed but never surrendered
