Sunlight stripes the mountain  
rending it's colors intwain  
Orange divides green divides red  
in the sunburnt winter stead  
Drops from the ceiling, winter sparks again  
cold coming calling  
two walkers mittens holding hands  
blue begat white swirls on the high  
tops dusted and frosted from above  
below the earth is churning  
it's warm denizens curled in sleep  
Leaves bow heads in mourning  
Too late, so long, 'til solstice sweeps.  
Evergreen, wintergreen, you stand tall and proud  
friends of yours, the yellow soars  
above my head and below my feet.  
Needles fall,the bells swing, the doors open for all  
On Holiday, make merry all, til calender meets it's peak.
