    <p>Against me I want your warmth to be<br>Lay over me like a morning blanket<br>wrapped induced comfort and I never want to leave<br>Hair falls into my face and my mouth seeks yours like nuns seek God<br>Devoted, no reason but faith and the desire to feel<br>at peace with you; hands interleaved like branches of a tree<br>Mind distracted, nothing can alarm.<br>When I with you the angst is gone.<br>Dependency? Maybe, but all of us are.<br>On each other, on you, on me your body lies<br>curved unlike my appetite for your smile<br>It could be me in the stagelights of the part in your play<br>of man, lover, thoughts soaked with grey.<br>No need to fear, I am what I am, whatever role I have<br>do my best to be. Friend, companion, clown, nothing at all.<br>Wrapped tight in your arms, wrapped up in your life<br>living, learning, loving, take some time to think, figure<br>eights in my mind, can&#39;t deny what&#39;s real<br>don&#39;t know how to feel.  </p>
