Notebook drawn, your gun to fire on the world  
No admonishment, no harm, just words  
Look over, corner of eye. Scribbling words and  
composing on the fly.   
  
Cloud watching and eye sky snaired  
To what do you contrast and compare?    
Boxed words, seperated like 3rd grade math  
Hasty upstrokes, your thoughts bursting fast  
  
Listen to words you'll sing to later on  
Find peace in distracting solitude  
Eyes half closed and peering out  
I wonder, do you know? What I'm writing about.
