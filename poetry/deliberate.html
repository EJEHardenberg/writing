    <p>Our words are deliberate and Chosen.<br>Disconnect. Heart from Head. Objective.<br>Still it fights. You know you shouldn&#39;t<br>you keep on, and keep on.<br>What words can please both sides?<br>Tongue-tied and torn, making assumptions.<br>Heart to heart agree, mind to mind coincide.<br>Heart to head. Disconnect. Pull away.<br>How close is too close?
Decide together, but one party will lose out, 
a perfect split? impossible. One to one, take the hit. 
Too close. But savoring each moment,<br>the prick of spine from our dilemna a cross to bear.<br>Bare our words. Bare our hopes. Bear our desires.
What&#39;s wrong. What&#39;s right. Who decides when we can&#39;t?</p>
