sunlight. Late bloom.  
Winter's bite. Autumns through  
another year, another day  
more I give myself away  
  
these are they, rolling hills.  
Like fountains of land made still  
Birch white and forest green  
Foam and froth, leaves fall between  
  
The Basin growls, the clouds are cut  
Shaving off what waters raught  
Sky opens and the heavens fall  
Water comes to wash it all
