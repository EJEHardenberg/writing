    <p>The blue in the sky matches the azure of the lake.<br>Clouds billowing inside waves thunder.<br>Rustling at the edges with leaves blossoming from silent sentinals.<br>The busy of the day begins to take its pace.<br>The hustle of the crows pushing life&#39;s race.<br>Swift to run but slow to walk.<br>The people look down and no one talks.<br>Their phones in hand and their eyes glued.<br>Moderation is key, it&#39;s sad but true.<br>Technology ruining us as we&#39;re too ready to abuse.<br>Don&#39;t miss your chance, fight the itch:<br>to look down and text, and avoid commonplace<br>interactions between us, we&#39;re limited too.<br>What media tells us, becuase we&#39;re all skewed.<br>Get up and go out. Bring your phone along<br>an emergency device, for finding some fun.<br>But when you&#39;re out there with your friends, eyes alight with laughter<br>be in the moment, no need for social media chatter.   </p>
