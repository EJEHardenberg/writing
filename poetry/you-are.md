Dew drops. Quiet walk.   
Sleepy eyes rubbing out  
Ambling days mixed late night talk  
  
First thing, check phone  
Your name, my lips.  
Always smiling to your kiss  
  
Conversation, game of wits  
Getting sentimental  
Apologies  
  
Sunlight corner -- eye blind  
Clouds, mountain, trees, grass.  
Obvious: Peace of mind
