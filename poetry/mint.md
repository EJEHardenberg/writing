Drift away, white cream wind blows  
Across bumpy red river flows  
The roof cool to touch, the gum stuck  
And on bedding a sweet repose.  
  
Coloured snow and darkly coated  
Breathy flavor ne`er impeded  
White cane standing with red loops down  
sticky and hanging from pine tree spirit.  
  
Lasting for lovers, sensual stinging  
Captive in mouth, for sharing with feeling  
Gentle to touch, ice melting down  
flowing through body, head spinning round.
