Don't see. Don't look.   
What's that? Over there?   
Hands over their mouths   
in horror of travesty, shock.  
Worried whispers, "she's different, she's not right"    
No one sees, the tear, the fear, the longing to be   
What you want, what you could never need  
Misunderstood, self-riteous and vehement  
Turn your head, look away, let someones problem render dead  
The blood's on you; the blood's on me  
part of the problem, part of the solution, part of me.
