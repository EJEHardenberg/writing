    <p>I&#39;d be a tad sad for a lad going mad for you.
 I&#39;d be glad to add to your madness, lad! 
 Though it may be a fad, I&#39;m no cad and will not make you sad.
Dearest Darling, dang dapper discussion to deal down! 
A fad fits fools falling for feminine fatales!
 True. A terriby transient thing, this tad madness!
Won&#39;t you be mad with me darling?
Fools fawning and frolicking through the fields of life?
A summertime romance to be enjoyed? 
A kiss on the lips in a park, a hand held in mine in the dark.
A twirl and a twist as our tango lifts us embraced.
 I&#39;ll tango with you, for a month, maybe two.
 We&#39;ll satisfy madness with laughter and gladness. 
 And then, when we part, for our lives lived apart
 we&#39;ll savor the thought of those times that we knew.
To touch and dance in sway, theres more than one way.
Though oceans apart, a letter in flight may rise a glum day.
Parted by choice, our lives may see. 
A day to return to the gladness we&#39;ll see.</p>
