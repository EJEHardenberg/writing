    <p>I&#39;d be a tad sad for a lad going mad for you.<br> I&#39;d be glad to add to your madness, lad!<br> Though it may be a fad, I&#39;m no cad and will not make you sad.<br>Dearest Darling, dang dapper discussion to deal down!<br>A fad fits fools falling for feminine fatales!<br> True. A terriby transient thing, this tad madness!<br>Won&#39;t you be mad with me darling?<br>Fools fawning and frolicking through the fields of life?<br>A summertime romance to be enjoyed?<br>A kiss on the lips in a park, a hand held in mine in the dark.<br>A twirl and a twist as our tango lifts us embraced.<br> I&#39;ll tango with you, for a month, maybe two.<br> We&#39;ll satisfy madness with laughter and gladness.<br> And then, when we part, for our lives lived apart<br> we&#39;ll savor the thought of those times that we knew.<br>To touch and dance in sway, theres more than one way.<br>Though oceans apart, a letter in flight may rise a glum day.<br>Parted by choice, our lives may see.<br>A day to return to the gladness we&#39;ll see.  </p>
