For your Eyes alone I am no longer lonely  
For your kiss my lips revel no more in their solitude  
For your arms to hold and cradle my heart, such burning I have ne'er felt  
For your body against mine I crave to melt with you  
Into blissful Euphoria I sink as you gently smile to me  
For your Eyes alone can shiver my soul
