Blue feet tingling and leather soul ran  
thin  
Close my eyes, pull woal, fall away  
again?  
Thoughts shifting, heart aching, a burning desire  
To be  
whole with you, your company new but ever-so  
familiar  
Embrace, comfortable, nothing has changed despite  
time  
to melt, eroding your guard, wanting you  
can you feel it?  
I dared to think you want me too
