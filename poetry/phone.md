Bell on the line. Waking me up.  
Nothing better than that final stroke  
A touch. A kiss. Hand to my lips  
Cupped under chin and at it again.  
  
Lost in tales of hardshipped days  
Listen and sigh, modern ways.  
Come to me, bring your cares  
I'll listen, nod, and a smile you can't see
How nice would it be; to be in your company  
  
The wires long, the signals thin, 
ring again, again, again. like two teens sick  
With words like ours, can't get enough
but can't ever win.  
  
Reminisce with me, think about it, laugh.   
I've no regrets of what we've done in the past  
Ok to reflect, lovely to feel
on the other end of the phone: smile. Real.
