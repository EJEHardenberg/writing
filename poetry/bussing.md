Who knows who you are  
Ignoring each other staring out the window  
What you'll be or what you'll do today  
Don't you ever wonder?  
What does he she they them do?  
We're all in the same boat, the same routine  
Sit in comfortable silence, roar of an engine  
The seperation between us 1.5 feet wide  
enough space for our bubbles, enough space to be alone  
won't you talk? pass the time.  
You could meet me in the middle, center aisle conversation  
You won't. Because I won't. And first move is anyone's but ours.
