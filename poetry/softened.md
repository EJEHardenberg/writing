Transparently floating   
Looming saucers of dark blue hue    
under echos of orange breath the pillars rise   
Float on. Wet us with your voice  
The drumming of tin, the slap of breaking the surface   
gone to join, to many, now one.   
Blot the sky and bicker to the sun: cold, hot, forget it, gone  
Wrestle away with thoughts alone,   
what to give, what to take, leave none unturned.   
Slenderly slipping from your bottom  
make due with the air that's out.  
Alone for a moment, gone and forgotten.  
Until swept into the body again forcefully softened.
