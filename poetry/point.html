    <p>There is a point where there is nothing<br>There is no tie. There are no restrictions.<br>An endless and insurmountable sea seperates what could be and what is<br>In this moment there is only what is and what you allow to be.<br>There is a point where the tangled infinities of coincidence meet.<br>Bursting from the void appears hope, happiness, lust, and love<br>In these times, the feelings are shared, the curiosity is expressed<br>The expressions are learned, the cues hinted and stored<br>We learn and predict and build the image of our affection<br>It is our mind that shapes the perceptions, and to this perception we endow and give ourselves.<br>There is a point where you have given yourself away<br>All you are willing to give has been placed on the table<br>The scraps you hold are those so deep and secreted that they are covered in darkness<br>They are the ones you will never say outloud<br>The truths that binds the mind and breaks the soul in two when brought to light<br>Light that pierces the veil our minds make to cover the horror we allow ourselves to become<br>There is a point where those truths are given freely<br>There is a fear in the moments of our greatest expression<br>There is joy in this suffering agony.<br>The curtain removed, the chains undone, the locks unhinged.<br>The door swings loose against itself, the wind of our minds billowing it&#39;s frame<br>There is a point where there is nothing left to say, but every reason to say it.<br>This is the time when most fail to do what is needed.<br>Just because one knows, does not mean the other does as well.<br>Communication is two way and ten fold<br>The pursuit of education should never stop with a partners.<br>There is always something more to learn and love and hate<br>There is a point.  </p>
