They say: You can't have it all  
They say: It's the thought that counts  
They say: Think outside the box  
They say: You can be whatever you want  
They say: Nothing comes for free  
They say: Action speaks louder than words  
They say: It's not you it's me  
They say: You give what you get  
Who cares what they say?  
I say: Not to make excuses  
I say: It's what you say that counts  
I say: The cat inside the box is dead and alive  
I say: You can't please everyone  
I say: The truth is never without a price  
I say: Actions aren't always enough  
I say: It's not you it's me and now we're contradictory  
I say: You can't always repay a debt  
Who cares what I say?  
What do you say?
