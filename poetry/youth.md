the days when we were young  
nothing more than feathers on our minds  
not the weight of life and troubles  
the sky rising was enough to excite  
the oceans of our energy alive  
now and then we see it still  
maturity, immaturity, childlike thrill  
induced in ourselves by outside agents  
we breathe it in, drink it down, and savor it  
through the haze we gather our selves  
to begin again when hard times weigh down
