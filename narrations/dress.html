    <p>She&#39;s walking down the aisles of clothes she&#39;ll never buy. Hand running
through the soft fabric, watching the colors sway with each touch.
Burying her face into one, grasping with those small hands against the
folds of a dress. The patterns are simple, some floral, some velveted
stripes, but this one is simpler still.   </p>
<p>The smell of the lace is clean and neutral, department store fresh. To
her: a small sliver of heaven. She&#39;s never felt such sleek fabric
before, the gentle waves and spirals of the lace give under her touch.
Stepping back, wide-eyed she looks at her mother and asks if she can
have it. </p>
<p>No.</p>
