    <p>He sits looking out the window, feeling ill. The signs pass by
infrequently as he travels to his destination. The world outside these
glass windows looks lovely, the green of the trees a lovely contrast
against the cloud studded sky. </p>
<p>Yet, he feels ill. Not just the lurching feeling in his stomach from
hunger. Not just the hard swallow of intense thought. He feels ill at
ease. Like something is going to go wrong today. Unable to shake the
feeling, he looks down, wondering what it is that has his nerves on end.</p>
<p>Where did this feeling come from? Maybe it&#39;s all the doom and gloom of
various political books being read. Maybe it&#39;s the ever-increasing
insecurities of a world steeped in countless problems that can&#39;t be
solved. Or perhaps it&#39;s the dissatisfaction with work and the stiffling
of creativity he feels. </p>
<p>Looking out at the world. Looking out from this chair at the world on
the other side of the glass. He wonders. </p>
<p>Where are we going?</p>
