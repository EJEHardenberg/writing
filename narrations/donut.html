    <p>It&#39;s the texture that does it.<br>Soft. Flaking. Breaking as the slightest pressure of my mouth descends<br>When my teeth make contact, metal to frosting. It hurts.<br>I wish I could taste it.<br>The dough is light, and there&#39;s the sweet scent of it<br>But there is no taste.<br>Another bite. Chewing. Contemplatively Chewing<br>Getting past the rounded edge of the side<br>The filling appears. Deep red framed by powdery light brown and orange<br>This.<br>This has taste.<br>It is heavy, so much heavier than the rest of the morsel<br>Briefly my tongue feels the white cream on top, mixing with the<br>strawberry jam.<br>Briefly.<br>Then there is again only texture. Only scent. Only chewing.<br>I am 3 bites bored.<br>I buy this as a treat to myself. To go with my plain bagel<br>My childish orange juice<br>My sweet nothing.<br>How can someone understand it? I have selective taste.<br>With food. With drink. With Wine. With Women.<br>There are many of each of these things, yet only a few hold me.<br>A few hold my attention and have taste.<br>A few years ago, friends told me I had no taste when I told jokes<br>A few years ago I lost my taste for joking that way.  </p>
