    <p>Her hand smoothed his hair back and out of his eyes. Quietly, she peered
at him. In the darkness, even the subdued tone of the yellow desk lamp
made their eyes catch fire. Brown gazed into Green.  </p>
<p>The warmth of her sweater felt good, spread eagled over his body. As she 
leaned on her hands, her elbow against his chest, his own hand mimiced
her and pushed the lockes of hair out of her face. Turning, his hand 
cupped her face. Thumb caressing the soft cheeks of her smile. </p>
<p>Head turned, she kissed his palm. Then his wrist. Burrowing into his 
shoulder, she mouthed at his neck. Feeling his squirming body underneath
hers. Arms around each other, they flipped. It was the man&#39;s turn to lean
an elbow onto a chest -- though his hand rested around her breast, 
playfully squeezing it as he looked from her eyes, to her nose, to her 
lips and back up again. His hand swept down from her breast to her side.</p>
<p>Her giggle at the light tickling pulled his face into a cheeky grin. 
She murmored for him not to, a laughter in her eyes. Pushing his luck, 
feigning ignorance, and mischievously he ran his hand down her side
again. Her arms came up to stop him, his hands met her&#39;s before they 
could stop and he pulled her arms above her head and hovered over her
face. </p>
<p>His breath on her face, she lay waiting. Anticipating another tickle. 
Instead, his lips pressed to hers. Letting go of her hands, he felt her
bring them to his waist. Her body was tense underneath his, and he smiled
as she grabbed his waist, holding back his laughter and pretending it
didn&#39;t tickle. </p>
<p>She tried again, wriggling her fingers against his ribs. In response he
buried his face between her shoulder and the bed, laughing into her ear. 
Her legs wrapped around him, holding him in place as she tickled his
sides some more. </p>
<p>Something wet made her scream happily and her hands grabbed his body. 
Pulling it closer as his tongue tickled her ear and his teeth nibbled
the lobe. Her laughter turned to short sighs of pleasure as he worked 
his way from ear to the jawline and down her neck. Poised over her 
stretching like a cat, he smiled.</p>
